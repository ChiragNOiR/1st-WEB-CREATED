            Google will open its first Google Store later this summer
          </div>
        </div>
        <a href="./description.html">

            While Apple has enjoyed the success of a physical store for 20 years now,
            Google is now getting in on the action and will open its first-ever brick-and-mortar store later this
            summer.
            Interestingly enough, the company decided to announce its new project just a day after Apple celebrated its
            20th anniversary of the Apple Store.
            The Google Store was announced via Google’s official blog and described as the “first-ever physical retail
            store.”
            According to the blog post, the Google Store will offer a wide palette of Google hardware such as Fitbits,
            Nest devices, Pixel phones, and more.
            However, this is not the first attempt by Google to get into the physical retail store arena. Google is
            known for its seasonal pop-up stores that appear around the holidays,
            its small stores within Best Buy in the United States, and some other larger stores worldwide. Then there
            were Google’s Barges, floating retail showrooms that traveled the world to showcase Google’s tech and
            products.
            But that project never saw the light of the day because of fire safety concerns.

            Can you use a PlayStation 4 controller on a PlayStation 5?
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-body">
          <p>If you’ve just gotten a new PlayStation 5 but don’t want to let go of your PlayStation 4 or its
            controllers,
            you might be wondering if you can use your DS4 controllers on your new console.
            After all, the DualSense controller is $70, and you might want to play multiplayer titles without paying the
            extra.
            Sony has stated that the DS4 controllers will connect to the PS5, but will they work with every game?
            Can you use them interchangeably with the DualSense, in case you prefer the older feel? What about playing
            older games via back-compatibility? Let’s dive in.</p>
          Yes, you can use your DualShock 4 controllers on your new PlayStation 5, but there’s a catch. You can’t use
          them to play any games released for the PS5,
          only your back catalog of PS4 games. They just won’t work on the new games,
          and Sony says that’s because of how the new features on the DualSense controllers are set up.
          You’ll also need a DS4 controller if you want to play PSVR, because all of the PSVR titles currently available
          are all the PlayStation 4 versions. Once Sony releases PS5 PSVR, you’ll probably have to use the DualSense
          controllers for those titles.

            Google’s free unlimited storage on Google Photos will officially end on June 1
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-body">
          The time has come. Google is ready to officially end the company’s offering of free
          unlimited storage for high-quality images on Google Photos. Starting June 1, any new
          photos uploaded to the service will count as part of the free 15 GB that Google gives to all account holders.
          Starting next month, Google users will be limited in the photos they can upload to
          the cloud storage system for free. Right now, the company allows for unlimited s
          torage of high-quality photos on Google Photos, but that will soon change. As of
          the June 1 update, users will be limited to 15 GB of overall storage across all
          of the company’s various cloud-storage services. For those that already have over 15 GB of photos stored,
          don’t worry, as Google will not be removing them, you’ll simply be at the capped amount
          once the service stops offering free unlimited storage.
          This may be some sad news to those of you with large picture collections on Google Photos,
          but 15 GB is still a lot of storage. A compressed, high quality photo is generally 1-4MB in size,
          which means you should be able to store around 300 photos per gigabyte of storage. Still,
          this may not be enough for some users with thousands of images they need to store.
          If you are one of those users who have too many photos to store on Google’s free 15GB platform,
          there are other options, but you’re going to have to pay. Of course, you always have the
          option of storing photos locally, and Google has an intuitive process that lets you
          download a backup of all of your files.
          If local storage isn’t an option for you, Google does offer paid subscription that
          will give users much more available storage. With plans starting at $1.99 per month for
          100 GB of storage, most users should be able to find a storage plan that fits their needs.
          While it is sad that Google is ending the free unlimited photo storage,
          it has been coming for some time. The company initially announced the move in November, and,
          though it did not specify what led to this decision, allowing for all of that free storage must have been
          costly.
